# The Arrogance of Space Mapping Tool
See running version: https://cyklokoalicia.sk/arrogance/

## What is this?
A mapping tool to show how much space is dedicated to cars in our cities compared to space for peds, bicycles, green and even buildings. Upload an aerial or satellite photo from your city - an intersection or neighbourhood - and start mapping how much space is allocated to cars, pedestrians and bikes.

## Proof of concept
Working proof of concept. I decided to try to put this together in about two hours and I did. Later I spent some more on fixing bugs and adding functionality etc. Please, don't mind quality of code, but feel free to improve it.
**Pull requests are welcome.**

## Original concept
Original concept by Mikael Colville-Andersen, Copenhagenize.
